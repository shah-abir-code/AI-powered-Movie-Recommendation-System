ðŸŽ¬ AI Powered Movie Recommendation System

The AI Powered Movie Recommendation System is an intelligent application that helps users discover movies they are most likely to enjoy using the power of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. The system analyzes user preferences, movie features, and patterns from large datasets to deliver personalized and accurate recommendations.

This project uses both Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering techniques. The Content-Based approach recommends movies similar to the ones a user has already watched or liked by analyzing metadata such as genres, cast, crew, and keywords. The Collaborative Filtering method utilizes user behavior and ratings to identify similarities between users and suggest movies that like-minded people have enjoyed.

The AI model is trained on datasets from sources like TMDB or IMDb, which contain thousands of movie records. Data preprocessing involves cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction using methods such as TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to measure how closely movies are related. The system can also integrate NLP techniques to understand movie overviews and improve the semantic accuracy of recommendations.

A simple yet interactive user interface is developed using Streamlit or Flask, allowing users to input their favorite movie and instantly receive a list of related films. Additionally, the system provides visual insights into data distribution, popular genres, and user preferences using matplotlib and seaborn visualizations.
